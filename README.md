# MyBudgetApp

### This Repo has 3 main projects.
1. BudgetAppVaporServer - A Swift based server using Vapor 4.
2. TestingBudgetApp - Where I did some testing with the Vapor server.
3. MyBudgetApp - The true client app for this personal project.

### Objectives of this project.
1. Practice SwiftUI and explore functionality that I haven't been able to use at work.
2. Create a Swift based server for the app using Vapor 4.
3. Use Firebase (use it for testing builds and remote configuration at work but haven't personally used it)
